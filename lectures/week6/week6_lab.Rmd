## Create a data visualization
For today's class, you will work on creating a data visualization with a teammate. You will use the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) dataset provided to you via Piazza. Please note: this dataset was provided to us by the Framingham Heart Study for educational purposes. It is not a public dataset, nor is the data publishable, as FHS has made some alterations to the data.

By 2pm, you should have posted a final version of your data graphic on Piazza, along with the code you used to create it. A few of them will be chosen and discussed by the whole class.
