#### Course summary and goals

The aim of this course is to provide students a foundational training in the modern tools of statistical computing and reproducible research. In particular, we will focus on learning the R programming language, the RMarkdown syntax, and the git version control system. Students will learn how to manipulate, summarize, analyze, and visualize data using R. This course will focus more on the computing than on the statistics, but students will be exposed to statistical concepts and strategies such as sampling, simulation, expected values, etc... along the way.
